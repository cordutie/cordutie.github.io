<h2>🎵 Bio</h2>

<p>Esteban is a PhD student at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona, where he conducts research in the Music Technology Group under the supervision of Xavier Serra and Frederic Font. His work focuses on sound representations for conditioned sound generation, at the intersection of machine learning and sound synthesis.</p>

<p>He holds undergraduate and master’s degrees in Mathematics from the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, where he worked with Dr. Giuseppe De Nittis on K-theory and its connections to edge current phenomena in the context of the Quantum Hall effect. He later pursued a Master’s in Sound and Music Computing, studying under Lonce Wyse and exploring statistics-driven DDSP approaches to texture sound synthesis.</p>

<p>In parallel with his research, he has taught a range of undergraduate mathematics courses—including Calculus, Linear Algebra, Ordinary Differential Equations, and Discrete Mathematics—at PUC, USACH, and UPF. His academic interests lie broadly in sound synthesis, signal processing, and the computational modeling of music and sound.</p>
